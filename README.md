Code generation.

CgenEmitVisitor.java
For this task, we used a divide and conquer strategy. For each visitor, we created a simple cool program in good.cl, and ran coolc good.cl to see the expected output. From there, we used trial and error to complete each visitor until we got the results we wanted to achieve.

Cgen.java
After completing the majority of the visitors and seeing some tests still fail, we focused our attention for Cgen.java. We completed the todos in this file by looking at the similar functions already given to us, and then using trial and error until we got the right results.

CgenCalcTemps.java
Similar to Cgen.java, we looked at the similar functions given to us, and modified them in a way that works correctly with our program.

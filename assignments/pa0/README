================================================

This directory contains the following files:

 atoi.cl
 stack.cl
 stack.test

    README this file

        atoi.cl is an implementation in Cool of the string to integer
        conversion function.

        stack.cl is the template file which you should fill in with
        your program.

        stack.test is a short test input to the stack machine.


Instructions
------------

    Make sure coolc and coolspim are on your PATH.  Do this by adding two
    directories to your path:
    1. Either  bin/.orig/.Linux  or  bin/.orig/.Darwin  (as appropriate)
    2. bin
    That will also add other programs needed for A1-3 (e.g., buildme, testme,
    ...) to your path.

    To compile your COOLC program, enter assignments/pa0 and type

        coolc stack.cl atoi.cl

    To run your program on a short test provided, type:

        coolspim -file stack.s < stack.test

    Try it right now -- it should work, and print "Nothing implemented"
    (among a few other things).
